<p><strong>But Allah hath permitted trade (bay) and forbidden usury (riba).‚Äù&nbsp;(Al-Baqarah 2:275)</strong></p>
<p>By reflecting on the above Quranic verse and recognizing the need of more social entrepreneurs for the society, UNIPRO organized Entrepreneurship workshop series under the mentorship of Entrepreneur &amp; Trainer, Bro. Kamaludeen and Alhamdhulillah, more than 80 brothers are benefited&nbsp;from this series and exposed to key areas of entrepreneurs&nbsp;world such as local trading, international business, marketing, social media, GST, Practical demo, etc.</p>
<p>The uniqueness of UNIPRO is that we drive more towards practicality and we are more humbled to say that 15 entrepreneurs from diverse fields ranging from Artificial Intelligence to Organic farming are created due to this initiative within few months by the grace of Almighty. In Sha Allah, We committed to organize such workshops in near future to create more social entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Stay tune for next updates !</p>
