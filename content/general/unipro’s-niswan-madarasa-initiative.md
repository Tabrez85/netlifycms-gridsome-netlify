<p>The prophet Muhammad(peace be upon him) said “The whole world is a provision and the best object of benefit of the world is the pious woman”</p>
<p>As per his sayings, UNIPRO dreamt of raising pious women in the society and by the grace of Allah(SWT), the dream comes true. UNIPRO’s efforts in it’s own adopted village “THAMARAIKUPPAM” and the field level efforts of state level NGO UNWO transformed the Niswan Madarasa of the Village to be fully operational and around 60-65 women of the village is going to lead a life of Islam in the society.</p>
<p>May Allah(SWT) raise pious women from the village and increase them in useful knowledge.</p>
