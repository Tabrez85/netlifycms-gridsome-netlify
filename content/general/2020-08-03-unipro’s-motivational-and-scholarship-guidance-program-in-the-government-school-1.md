As per UNIPRO’s strong commitment in the area of constructing a society of educationalists, our team has conducted **Motivational, Empowerment and Scholarship Guidance** program in **Madarasa-e-Azam government school** on 18th February, 2017 with the motto of strengthening the school with modern educational techniques in order to make them compete with top metropolitan schools.

**Mr.Y.Mohamed Rabik,** Assistant Professor of AMS Engineering College and his team members has presented motivational speech for 10th and +2 students in order to compose them self-reliant in facing board exams and has also given scholarship guidance to comfort their feelings to the extent of money not being a barrier to pursue higher education.

Alhamdhulillah, By the grace of Allah SWT and with the co-ordinative support from the school head master, 10th and +2 students (both English medium and Urdu medium) get benefited largely and given positive feedbacks about the event.May Allah SWT accept our efforts and may grant enlightened future for all those students.
