<p>UNIPRO had received a medical help request for a lorry driver aged 23 whose leg was broken in an accident on 2012. After the accident he was unable to move anywhere &amp; just sit idle in home.  Due to financial constraints they couldnâ€™t proceed for further treatment.  With Almighty help some teams supported  &amp; they looked for treatment in 2015 &amp;  MIOT hospital only gave positive response to recover to old state. </p>
<p>Total cost of the operation is around 4.5 Lakhs. With the help of Almighty Allah, few trusts/teams supported for the payment of 3.8 Lakhs. UNIPRO contributed Rs.60,000/- for this operation which has been paid by cheque directly to the MIOT hospital.</p>
<p>All operations are done &amp; our Brother got discharged from hospital, Alhamdulillah! Doctors gave medication for next few months &amp; keep observing the results with regular check-ups. It will take some more months to get back into normal. In Sha Allah! Please dua for our brother to recover soon.</p>
